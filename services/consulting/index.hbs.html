					<p>Logiblock knows the best way to design anything is to iterate - this holds true for both arts and engineering. We are committed to remaining agile in our design iterations, capitalizing on today's rapid-prototyping technologies to keep cycle times short and never compromise for inertia.</p>
					<p>We take this philosophy a step further by <strong>designing and iterating hardware and software as one.</strong> For example if a change of pin-assignment can reduce energy consumption, decrease code size or improve performance we will not hesitate to <strong>prototype, implement and verify, across teams, often within the same hour.</strong> Likewise, if a software discovery allows us to reduce component count, we will prototype and recommend the change immediately, rather than leaving it for version 2.0.</p>
