						<p>
							Hardware startups and the <a class="wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Things">Internet of Things</a> are a funny business.
							My experience started in earnest after <a href="/products/galago">Galago</a>, when I began to get involved actively in the hardware startup scene in the San Francisco Bay Area.
							My initial objective was to understand how these startups could use an integrated module such as Galago to establish a large portion
							of their product's functionality very quickly, then focus on developing the aspects that make their offering different from others.
							This was, after all, my original objective with Galago - to introduce the software framework mentality developers use
							to build a website or an iOS app to hardware products.  Unfortunately this objective was based on what turned out to be a very na√Øve assumption.
						</p>
						<img src="/static/blog/modules.jpg"/>
						<p>
							The idea of modules in electronics design certainly isn't new.  You could think of Arduino-class boards as modules offering general I/O
							functionality and friendly development tools.  There are several that offer WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy and other valuable features on top
							of the aforementioned simplicity.  There are also a wide variety of surface-count wireless modules that carry regulatory approval to speed
							up hardware design.	 And yet when one opens a commerical electronics product one doesn't usually see an interconnected set of
							highly-available, interchangeable, off-the-shelf, well-documented and/or open-source functional modules inside.  If standing on the shoulders
							of giants is how virtually all software is successfully made, why do we often not even see one such module inside (except those of the surface-mount
							wireless variety, which are common for another reason)?  I believe the answer is rooted in an old notion of how things should be built and
							in the unyielding - and irrational - drive to cut BOM cost.
						</p>
						<img src="/static/blog/carambola.jpg"/>
						<h3>Set us up the BOM.</h3>
						<p>
							The BOM, or <em>bill of materials</em> of a product is the cost of chips, circuit boards, plastics, batteries and other components
							that go into it.  It does not include the assembly and other labor costs of building the product, nor the costs of shipping, warehousing
							or otherwise getting the product to the consumer.  And crucially it does not include engineering costs
							(termed <a class="wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-recurring_engineering">NRE</a> expenses) sunk into developing the product.
							Rarely does a company accurately weigh development costs against per-unit costs, and to look at them side-by-side is an enlightening
							experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							It's quite clear that investing a little extra engineering time to save BOM cost is sensible if one expects to sell thousands of units.
							For example, suppose an engineer is tasked with switching from one sensor solution to another to save $1 on the BOM.  If she accomplishes
							this in one week, and at least 2500 units are sold, then it's a win, right?  No, unless she's badly underpaid then it is at best a break-even
							proposition.  Moreover there is risk associated with the switch and, worst of all, it doesn't necessarily improve customer experience when it's
							done.  What if she runs into compatibility problems and takes more than a week to do it?  What if it turns out to be impossible (or
							impractical)?  When this happens a hardware team loses precious time, can sacrifice market timing advantage and obviously wastes money.
						</p>
						<img src="/static/blog/chip-tray.jpg"/>
						<p>
							How a hardware startup designs its product can have effects far beyond good component choices.  Most products today include a programmable
							processor or microcontroller, and many include connectivity components such as USB, WiFi and Bluetooth (particularly its Low-Energy variant.)
							Suppose a team picks a CPU that costs $5 less than another.  $5 is a lot to save on a BOM for many consumer products and it looks very
							appealing to management and team leads.  Unfortunately, the harsh economic reality is that the new CPU cannot require more than two extra weeks
							of work per engineer (using the same salary as our earlier example) per thousand units sold.  Porting code to a new CPU is usually expensive,
							and if a component is $5 less costly then it's likely from a different product family from a different chipmaker.  And that's where it gets
							really expensive.
						</p>
						<p>
							There are well-known (if not widely-practised) principles in product development to avoid wasting time optimizing or making things nobody wants.
							Don't optimize prematurely.  Don't build something without validation and customer commitment.  Et cetera.  And yet premature design optimization
							and utter disregard for the time-cost and risk of engineering decisions remains rampant in both hardware and software startups.  While I believe
							small software teams have no reservations using a framework like Express, Django or Rails to build on the web, the notion of starting an electronic
							product on module(s) is appoached with caution by hardware teams.  Why is this?  Simply put, concepts like supply-chain risk, dimensional constraints
							and, yes, BOM cost do not factor into software platform judgements.  That said, if one adheres firmly to the NRE vs. BOM economics described above,
							starting with integrated modular components ought to be a sound choice.  Or is it?
						</p>
						<h3>Next time...</h3>
						<p>
							<em>In the next installment, I'll cover:</em>
							<ul>
								<li>The best modules currently available</li>
								<li>What hardware startups really want, and</li>
								<li>Why building modules is a tough business.</li>
							</ul>
