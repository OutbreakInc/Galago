					I know Cameron Robertson - co-creator of Lockitron - through the Y Combinator alumni network.  During the Crowdtilt
					crowdfunding meetup in SF, he and I spoke about the pressures and constraints of raising money on promises made to a
					community of buyer-backers and I made a strong case for my argument that crowdfunding is caught in a bubble.  At the
					time, I was between startup ideas and had serious doubts about the viability of the crowdfunded hardware project model
					in the long term.
