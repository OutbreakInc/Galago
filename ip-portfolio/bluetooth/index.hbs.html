					<h3>Concept: <em>BLE as the new universal user interface</em></h3>
					<p>Bluetooth Low Energy is a lower-cost, lower-power and more flexible option than designing a display or buttons into a product. Its pervasive, always-on low-energy wireless link allows graceful, uncomplicated integration into smartphone apps.  As such, those become the user interface for a new generation of products in the wearable, consumable, positional and deeply-integrated spaces.  Logiblock has experience developing these products and can help you design your product to maximize this new UI paradigm.</p>

					<h3>Standard: <em>Apple iBeacon</em></h3>
					<p>Apple introduced iBeacon, a specification built on top of Bluetooth Low Energy that provides an open, vendor-independent framework for near-field geospatial positioning, physical-context-aware software experiences and some NFC-like features.  iBeacon offers a veriety of valuable benefits to iOS application developers and is currently usable with third-party libraries on Android and other operating systems, with many of the same benefits.  Logiblock was an early implementer of iBeacon and can combine a this feature with any other Bluetooth services or functionality, boosting a hardware product with the ability to dramatically enhance mobile apps.  <a href="/#contact">Talk to us</a> about how we can put Apple iBeacon into your design.</p>
