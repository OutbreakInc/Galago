					<h2>GZIP on-chip</h2>
					<p>Compression technology is the underlying magic upon which virtually every rich digital experience we have is based. Without it, we would not have the proliferation of digital video, audio, apps and web content, much of which is compressed with gzip or its underlying algorithm, DEFLATE.</p>
					<p>Logiblock designed <strong>a gzip/DEFLATE decoder which requires only 750 bytes of RAM and about 1.5KB of code</strong>, a miniscule footprint compared to the reference zlib library.  This advancement makes possible practical compressed firmware updates, large geo datasets, animations, on-board documentation and other exciting applications. Additionally, the decoder can be used to implement <strong>extremely efficient <a href="/ip-portfolio/ota#delta">firmware delta-updates</a></strong> - which store only the changes from one version to another - with no additional software complexity by exploiting tricks in the decompressor state.</p>
