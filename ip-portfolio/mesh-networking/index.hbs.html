					<h2>Low-energy wireless mesh networks</h2>
					<p>Logiblock developed and maintains a mesh-networking technology that is designed to run concurrently with the <a href="/ip-portfolio/bluetooth">Bluetooth Low Energy</a> stack on <a href="/ip-portfolio/bluetooth/#nordic-ble">chips from Nordic Semiconductor</a>.  Our system is built on a well-known commercial protocol and operates concurrently with the Bluetooth Low Energy stack.  Our proprietary high-level mesh-forming, auto-balancing and packet routing logic demonstrates effective, reliable communication that consumes under 20ÂµA per graph edge at 10-meter edge radius.</p>

					<p>Mesh networks are a special kind of network with unique characteristics and design constraints. While they don't need to interoperate with third-party routers or smartphones, mesh networks need special attention to make set-up easy which maintains a great user experience for the product.</p>
					<p>Logiblock's mesh-networking is designed to auto-assemble and auto-balance a network with no user interaction required. See the <a href="#intro">introduction</a> for why this is important.</p>

					<h3>Concept: <em>Introduction to mesh networks</em></h3>

					<blockquote><p><em>Many conventional networks operate in a 'star' topology (USB, <a href="/ip-portfolio/bluetooth">BLE</a>, <a href="/ip-portfolio/wifi">Wi-Fi</a>.) The Internet itself is a type of mesh network.</em></p></blockquote>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-9">
					<p>A mesh network is a network topology in which multiple nodes are sparsely connected to various other nodes, the number of which is called its <em>'degree'.</em> </p>
					<p>In low-energy wireless mesh networks, <em>'assembly'</em> refers to devices discovering one another and forming a network, and <em>'balancing'</em> describes creating and breaking links so that connections between nodes are evenly distributed.</p>
