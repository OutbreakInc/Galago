					<h2>What is Galago?</h2>
					<p>Galago is a rapid electronics prototyping board that combines a powerful ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller with a <a href="#debugger">hardware debugger</a> in a tiny format, allowing hobbyists and professionals alike to turn project ideas into reality faster and better than other microcontroller platforms.</p>
					<h2>Use it!</h2>
					<p>Plug Galago into a standard breadboard for quick prototyping, pop it into an <a href="/products/galago/#appboards">app board</a> to build an application or solder it directly into your <a href="/products/galago#pro">commercial product</a>.</p>

					<h2>Developing with Galago</h2>
					<p>Galago plugs into a standard solderless breadboard or an <a href="/products/galago#appboards">app board</a> and connects to your computer with USB.  The USB connection permits downloading and debugging firmware, plus it will power Galago if it's not connected to another power source.</p>
					<p><strong>Write easy-to-understand code <em>- built on C++</em></strong> with Galago's simple but powerful development tool and deploy it to the hardware with a single click.</p>
					<p><strong>Use the integrated debugger</strong> to pause code execution, inspect variables and continue running - this helps you quickly find software problems as they arise to fix them faster with less head-scratching.</p>

					<h2>Debugger</h2>
					<p>Software usually doesn't work the first time, even for experienced engineers.</p>
					<p><strong>A <em>debugger</em> is a tool that lets you stop a program as it's running</strong> so you can inspect the values of variables and memory. This lets you determine where and why it went wrong. You may also <em>step</em> through the program as Galago runs each line of your code so you can see how it flows. At your command, the program will continue running or start over.</p>
					<p><strong>A debugger gives you the information you need to fix bugs in your code.</strong>  Galago's debugger, built into the development tool, makes it easy to fix your code and download the revised program with just another click.</p>

		<h3>Compatibility</h3>
		<p>Galago's IDE (development tool) is built on open-source technology from <a class="ext" href="http://gnu.org" target="_blank">The GNU Project</a> and <a class="ext" href="http://ajax.org" target="_blank">Ajax.org</a>.  Internally, it uses GCC to compile code and GDB to debug it.  The Galago IDE lets you write, compile and debug arbitrary C and C++ code with or without the Galago libraries.</p>

		

		<h2>Galago compared</h2>
		<p>Galago is the perfect compromise between features, power and size. Moreover, it has been engineered to exceed your expectations for ease-of-use and durability.</p>
		<h3>Compared to 8-bit boards</h3>
		<p>8-bit microcontroller boards, like Arduino&reg;, the SparkFun&reg; Pro Mini and the PJRC Teensy&trade; are very popular.  Boards like these changed the world of hobby electronics by introducing an adaptable platform with a low barrier to entry.  <strong>Galago goes several steps further by offering indispensible features, like on-board debugging, at an unbeatable value.</strong>  After developing on Galago, you'll never go back.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Galago's integrated debugger makes for faster, less frustrating development.  8-bit boards generally lack a built-in debugger, requiring purchase of an expensive hardware device and hard-to-use software.</li>
			<li>The 32-bit ARM microcontroller at the heart of Galago outclasses 8-bit chips while providing four times the memory and running at four times the speed of the most popular ones.  32-bit code makes calculations faster and enables more sophisticated applications.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Compared to other ARM-powered boards</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Other boards are usually larger, more expensive and frequently lack Galago's debugging capability.  Those that include a hardware debugger usually require restricted, feature-limited IDEs from the chipmaker.</li>
			<li>No other ARM board offers Galago's easy-to-use IDE and community features.</li>
			<li>Much of the code for other ARM boards is directly usable on Galago, or easily ported to it.</li>
		</ul>
