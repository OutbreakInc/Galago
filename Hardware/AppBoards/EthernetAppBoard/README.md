Etherblock is easy to assemble.  Simply follow these steps:

- *Insert the 14-pin female 0.1" headers into the board and flip the assembly over.*  The rows will not hold themselves in so you must keep it affixed by hand.
- *With the assembly upside down, press with your finger between the header rows to hold it together and solder corner pins.*  The easiest way is to **tack** the end pins of each header to hold it in, then properly solder all the other pins.  When all the others are done, re-solder the end pins to achieve a good-quality connection.
- *Insert the barrel (power) jack into the top of the board and turn the assembly over again.*  The barrel jack does not hold itself in so you must hold it in by hand.
- *Solder the barrel jack's pins.*  This is a lot easier with the 14-pin female header sockets already installed.  You will need a substantial amount of heat, solder and time to fill the large pin holes of the barrel jack.  Be patient but don't worry about being delicate, these are comparatively tough connections.
- *Snap the Ethernet socket into the board.*  It only fits one way, and will hold itself in.  Push firmly but not so firmly that you risk squashing the pins if it's not aligned correctly.
- *Solder the 14 pins of the Ethernet socket.*
- *Clip all soldered points with flush cutters or wire cutters.*  Cut where the pin meets the solder blob, no closer for risk of cracking the soldered joint.
