					I have a passion for electronics, and like so much passion, it's irrational.  I can't explain precisely why I enjoy building electronic gadgets,
					tools or products and I have an even harder time justifying the time I spend on it, especially because it remains so difficult to
					build a business in this space.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is clear, however, that the electronics product industry has some pretty major problems.  The
					biggest and most obvious is that it remains an old-fashioned and exclusive industry in many ways, an industry that's hostile to
					the adventurous, underfunded and "startup-minded" explorer and the small team. Why is it so hard to get a datasheet for this?  Why
					are these development tools so awful?  Why is it so expensive to get things made?  These are real problems - many of which I've faced
					building Galago - and I refuse to accept that they cannot be solved.
